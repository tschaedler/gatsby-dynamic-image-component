# gatsby-dynamic-image-component
Generates dynamically diffrent images for desktop and mobile view, depending on the "relativeDirectory"-path.


## How to use ## 
Just copy and paste the component inside of your component-folder.
Maybe you need to change some path (e.g. relativeDirectory)

Create the following folder structure inside the images-folder:
- images
  - dektop-images
  - mobile-images
  
Inside of your parent-component:<br />
`import Image from "./common/heroImage"`
